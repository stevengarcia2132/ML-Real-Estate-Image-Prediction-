# ML-Real-Estate-Image-Prediction-

This repository was created for my 400 level machine learning class during my final semester at college.
The repository contains the data, code, and word document explaining the project proposal. 


# ReportMD
The reportMD file contains my analysis and explanation of the models I used for this project along with images. At the top of the page, there is also a link to where the data was sourced on Kaggle. I did not include the folder of real estate images but they can be found at that link. 

# Socal2.csv
This file contains the tabular data on the real estate data. It can also be found at the link at the top of the ReportMd file. 

# Tabular.ipynb
This file contains all the code I used to create the models that ran the tabular data. There are various models and charts a long with comments to help understand the code. The models in this file do not contain the code for the image data. 

# ImageModel.ipynb
This data contains the code for the pre-processing and model creation of XGBoost and Nural Net models. There are graphs and visualizations to help understand the performance of the model.
