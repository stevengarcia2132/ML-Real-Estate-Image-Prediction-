# ML-Real-Estate-Image-Prediction-

This repository was created for my 400 level machine learning class during my final semester at college.
The repository contains the data, code and word document explaining the project proposal. 


#Data
The data is from Kaggle.com. The data contains eight columns which are image id, bed, bath, price, street, city, city
number and square feet. As you can expect bed, bath, city number, and square feet are all numerical columns with the rest being strings.
One of the biggest challenges was finding a complete data set. I wanted a data set that contained images along with numerical columns so
I can create separate models for the image and numerical data. The data set I chose is authored by a current Adjunct Assistant Professor
of Data Science at the University of Maryland. The author states in a blog that the data comes from Weichertâ€™s website for Southern California listings.

#Work
The code for the model creation will be in a file called work.py. Here I will document my code and walk through the 
data preprocessing and models. Along with the models I will be using important metrics to measure the usefulness of the model.
These metrics include the ROC, AUC, and MSE among other that will be used.
